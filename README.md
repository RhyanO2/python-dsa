A small collection of Python algorithms and exercises I made to learn logic, data structures, and algorithms.

## About
This repository contains short implementations and examples (sorting, searching, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.) intended for learning and practice rather than production use.

## Contents
- Algorithms implemented in plain Python
- Small example scripts and simple tests
- Organized by topic (e.g., sorting, trees, graphs, dp)

## How to use
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/RhyanO2/python-dsa.git
2. Run the example scripts or import modules in an interactive session:
   python path/to/example.py

## Contributing
Feel free to add more algorithms, improve existing implementations, or include explanations and complexity notes.

## License
Use however you like — add a license file if you want to specify terms.
